            My name is Awdrey Candido 😎. I am 22 years old, I live In
            Pernambuco, Brazil and I'm a self-taught Front-End developer. At the
            moment I'm a college student of Information Systems at Universidade
            Federal Rural de Pernambuco.

            I've started to learn about this incredible world of technology with
            the C programming language, but after some more research, I found
            myself in love with the Front-End way to live 😁. But recently I was
            flirting with native mobile development with Kotlin, You can see it
            in my Github, so let's see where it goes.

            More about me? As any developer I don't live without coffee, I have
            a strange addiction with cats and Elvis songs... Uhhh, you only
            wanna know about software? It is secret 🤫, but I can tell more if
            you're really interested. Just contact me!
